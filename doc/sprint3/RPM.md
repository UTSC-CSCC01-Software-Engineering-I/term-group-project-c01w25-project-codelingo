# Release Plan - Sprint 3

## Release Name: Sprint 3

## Release Objectives

### Specific Goals
- Introduce user progress tracking for modules and questions.
- Launch real-time collaborative coding feature for competitions.
- Refactor backend for improved scalability and modularity.
- Expand admin capabilities with bulk import/export of problems.
- Finalize full CRUD for lessons, questions, and test cases.
- Improve overall user interface responsiveness and accessibility.

### Metrics for Measurement
- User progress data accurately logged and retrieved (checked via test cases and Firebase analytics).
- Real-time coding collaboration operates without latency (monitored via socket logs and user testing).
- Backend endpoints exhibit improved performance and lower response time (measured through load testing).
- Admin bulk operations perform successfully and reflect in the database (verified via UI logs and DB entries).
- Successful CRUD operations for content management (validated via automated and manual tests).
- UI improvements positively impact engagement and lower bounce rate (tracked through analytics).

## Release Scope

### Included Features
- **Progress Tracking**: Store and visualize user progress across modules and problem sets.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Users can join coding sessions together for competitions.
- **Admin Enhancements**: Bulk import/export problems, filter content, manage tags.
- **Lesson & Question Management**: Full CRUD implementation for all content types.
- **Improved Architecture**: Backend refactored for microservice-friendly design and scalability.
- **Responsive UI Improvements**: Optimized layout and accessibility for better user experience.

### Excluded Features
- **Gamification Features (Points/Leaderboard)**: To be released in Sprint 4.
- **Personalized AI Recommendations**: Still under development and data collection.

### Bug Fixes
- Addressed lag issues in the coding environment on lower-end devices.
- Resolved token expiry issues in user sessions.
- Fixed inconsistencies in lesson save/publish flow.
- Corrected duplicate rendering in discussion panel.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Achieve under 200ms average response time for all major API calls.
- Ensure collaboration sync accuracy within 1 second.
- Maintain system stability for 100+ concurrent users during peak usage.
- Meet WCAG 2.1 accessibility standards in redesigned UI components.

## Dependencies and Limitations

### External Dependencies
- Firebase for user progress tracking and authentication.
- WebSockets/Socket.io for real-time collaboration.
- React + Redux for frontend state management.
- Node.js/Express for backend APIs.

### Known Limitations
- Real-time collaboration feature may be affected under unstable network conditions.
- Admin interface bulk actions currently lack undo functionality.
- Progress tracking is limited to questions and lessons, not discussions or competitions.

## Deployment Plan

### Steps to Carry Out the Deployment
1. Merge Sprint 3 branch into `main`.
2. Run full automated test suite and QA review.
3. Push to staging environment for internal verification.
4. Deploy to production via CI/CD pipeline.
5. Monitor metrics and logs for anomalies.

### PIV (Post Implementation Verification) Instructions
- Confirm user progress is saved and displayed accurately across sessions.
- Validate real-time coding works with multiple users simultaneously.
- Ensure admin tools support correct import/export with no data loss.
- Test responsiveness and keyboard accessibility in UI.
- Check that all CRUD operations reflect changes in the database in real-time.
