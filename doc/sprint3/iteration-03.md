## Process

### Roles & Responsibilities

- **Frontend Developer(s):**  
  Implement new UI components (e.g., game flows, leaderboard, statistics) using React (TypeScript) and integrate with backend services.

- **Backend Developer(s):**  
  Extend API functionality, manage user data, implement secure endpoints, and handle game logic.

- **DevOps Engineer:**  
  Maintain CI/CD pipelines, monitor infrastructure, and deploy updates.

- **QA Engineer:**  
  Design and execute integration tests, validate new features, and help catch edge cases in game mechanics.

As before, these roles act as general guidelines. Team members are encouraged to collaborate across the stack and take ownership of tasks based on their strengths and availability. Work is assigned via Jira and approached with flexibility and shared responsibility.
